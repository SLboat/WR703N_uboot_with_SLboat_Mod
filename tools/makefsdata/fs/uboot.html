                    WARNING!
                </strong>
                Upgrading the U-Boot is very dangerous operation and may damage your device!
                You have been warned!
                <br />
                If you upload wrong image, your router won't boot anymore and the only
                way to repair it will be manually reprogramming the FLASH!

                        do not power off the device during upload
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        if everything goes well, the router will restart and try to boot using
                        new U-Boot
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        in case of any error during or after image upload, LED(s) will blink fast
                        for a while and then the web failsafe mode will restart
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        you can upload whatever you want, so be sure that you choose proper U-Boot
                        image for your router!
